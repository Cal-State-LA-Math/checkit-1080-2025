    <content><p>Based on the graph's end behavior, is the leading coefficient of <m>f(x)</m> <em>positive or negative</em>? Explain how the graph tells you which.

        </content>
    <outtro>
        <p><m>{\large Answer}</m></p>
        <p>The leading coefficient is <em>{{lctext}}</em> for this polynomial.</p>
        <p>This is because, as <m>x</m> increases (as we read toward the right end of its graph), the value of <m>y</m> {{lcexplain}}.</p>

    <content><p>Based on the graph's end behavior, is the degree of <m>f(x)</m> <em>even or odd</em>? Explain how the graph tells you which.

        </content>
    <outtro>
        <p><m>{\large Answer}</m></p>
        <p>The degree of this polynomial must be <em>{{parity}}</em>.</p>
        <p>We can tell because as <m>x\to-\infty</m> we have <m>f(x) \to {{lend}}</m>, and as <m>x\to\infty</m> we have <m>f(x) \to {{rend}}</m>.</p>
        <p>Since these two end behaviors {{match}} (the <m>y</m>-values approach {{matchtwo}} infinities), this means the degree of <m>f(x)</m> is {{parity}}.</p>

    <content><p>Use the above information, and the graph, to determine a possible formula for <m>f(x)</m>, in factored form.

        <p>A formula for this degree-<m>{{deg}}</m> polynomial function might be </p>
