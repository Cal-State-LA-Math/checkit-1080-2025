            <p>You are standing {{hdist}} feet from the base of a tall oak tree. The tree is {{vhigh}} feet tall (relative to your eye level). What angle do you have to look up at to see the top of the tree? Explain how you figured it out. Show all of your work and give your answer in degrees rounded to two decimal places.</p>
