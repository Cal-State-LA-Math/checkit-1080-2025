            <p>You are practicing drone flight maneuvers for a certification test. Your spotter is standing {{H_dist}} meters away from the vertical line directly below your drone. They tell you they have to look up at a <m>{{angle}}^{\circ}</m> angle to see it. How high is the drone flying? Explain how you figured it out. Show all work and give your answer rounded to two decimal places. </p>
