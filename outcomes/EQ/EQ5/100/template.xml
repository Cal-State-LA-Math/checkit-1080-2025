    <intro><p>There are many ways to solve a quadratic equation, but sometimes it is better to use 
                one particular method. For each equation, determine which method would be the best to use. You must choose a different method for each equation and cannot use a 
                method more than once. </p></intro>

                For each of the equations above, solve using the method you stated 
                is the best to use. Do you still think that method was the best? Why or why not?
